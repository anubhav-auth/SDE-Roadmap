# Detailed Roadmap for Programming Proficiency (Java, Kotlin, Rust)

## 1. Advanced Java Proficiency
### 1.1 Core Concepts
- OOP Principles: Master encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Generics: Understand how to write generic classes and methods, and work with bounded wildcards (`<? extends T>`, `<? super T>`).
- Annotations: Custom annotations, reflection to process annotations.

##### 1.2 Multithreading and Concurrency
- Thread Basics: Learn how threads work (`Thread` class, `Runnable` interface).
- Concurrency Framework: `FixedThreadPool`, `CachedThreadPool`, synchronization (`synchronized` blocks, `wait()`, `notify()`), locks (`ReentrantLock`, `ReadWriteLock`).
- Advanced Concepts: `CompletableFuture`, Fork/Join Framework, thread-safe collections (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`, `BlockingQueue`), Java Memory Model (JMM).

##### 1.3 Design Patterns
- Creational: Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder.
- Structural: Adapter, Proxy, Composite.
- Behavioral: Observer, Strategy, Command.

##### 1.4 JVM Internals
- JVM architecture (Classloader, Method Area, Heap, Stack).
- Garbage collection (GC algorithms: G1GC, CMS).
- Profiling tools (VisualVM, JConsole).
- Bytecode basics and `javap` tool.

##### 1.5 Java 8+ Features
- Streams API and functional programming.
- Lambdas and method references.
- Optional class for null safety.
- New Date and Time API (`java.time` package).

##### 1.6 Networking and I/O
- Sockets (`Socket`, `ServerSocket`, `DatagramSocket`).
- NIO (Non-blocking I/O): Channels, Buffers, Selectors.
- Serialization and deserialization.

#### 2. Kotlin Proficiency
##### 2.1 Core Concepts
- Null safety (`?.`, `let`, Elvis operator).
- Higher-order functions and lambdas.
- Extension functions and properties.
- Delegated properties (`by lazy`, custom delegates).

##### 2.2 Coroutines and Asynchronous Programming
- Coroutine basics (`launch`, `async`, `withContext`).
- Flow API for reactive programming (`Flow`, `StateFlow`, `SharedFlow`).
- Structured concurrency and exception handling.

##### 2.3 Advanced Kotlin Features
- Sealed classes and data classes.
- Inline functions and reified types.
- DSLs with Kotlin syntax.

##### 2.4 Multiplatform Development
- Kotlin Multiplatform setup.
- Shared business logic for Android and iOS.
- Platform-specific implementations (`expect`/`actual` keywords).

#### 3. Rust Proficiency
##### 3.1 Core Concepts
- Ownership and borrowing rules.
- Lifetime annotations (`'a`).
- Error handling (`Result`, `Option`, `?` operator).

##### 3.2 Asynchronous Programming
- Async basics with `tokio` and `async-std`.
- Futures and the `await` syntax.
- Building simple async applications (e.g., web server, file downloader).

##### 3.3 Memory Management
- Understanding the stack vs. heap allocation.
- Smart pointers (`Box`, `Rc`, `Arc`, `Mutex`).
- Interior mutability and `RefCell`.

##### 3.4 Concurrency
- Mutexes, locks, and channels.
- Writing multi-threaded applications.
- Using `Rayon` for parallelism.

##### 3.5 Tooling and Ecosystem
- Package management with `Cargo`.
- Testing in Rust (`#[test]`, integration tests).
- Benchmarking and profiling.

##### 3.6 Advanced Rust
- Writing macros (`macro_rules!`).
- Unsafe Rust: when and how to use.
- Traits and generics.

#### 4. Practice and Projects
##### 4.1 Practice Platforms
- Java and Kotlin: LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces.
- Rust: Rustlings for exercises and Advent of Code for practice.

##### 4.2 Build Projects
- Java: Build a multithreaded server (e.g., chat server).
- Kotlin: Create a coroutine-based Android app with Kotlin Multiplatform support.
- Rust: Build a CLI tool (e.g., file compressor or task manager).
