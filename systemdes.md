### Detailed Roadmap for System Design

#### 1. Basics of System Design
- Goals of System Design:
  - Design systems that are scalable, reliable, and maintainable.
  - Focus on trade-offs between simplicity, performance, and cost.
- Key Concepts:
  - Scalability: The ability of the system to handle growth, whether in terms of users, transactions, or data.
  - Availability: Ensure the system is operational and accessible when needed.
  - Fault Tolerance: Design systems to recover gracefully from failures.
  - Latency and Throughput: Measure and optimize the response time and data processing capacity of your system.

#### 2. Core Concepts and Components
- Load Balancers:
  - Learn how to use load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
  - Study types of load balancing: Round-robin, Least connections, IP Hash, etc.
  - Understand Horizontal Scaling (adding more machines) vs Vertical Scaling (upgrading a single machine).
- Caching:
  - Understand the concept of caching and when to use it.
  - Study different types of caches: In-memory caching (Redis, Memcached), distributed caching.
  - Learn cache invalidation and handling cache consistency.
- Databases:
  - SQL vs NoSQL: Learn the use cases and differences between relational and non-relational databases.
  - Sharding: Partition data across multiple databases or servers.
  - Replication: Copy data between different database nodes for fault tolerance and performance.
  - CAP Theorem: Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance, and how to make trade-offs.

#### 3. Designing Distributed Systems
- Message Queues and Event Streaming:
  - Learn how message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka) decouple system components.
  - Understand their use cases for load leveling, retry mechanisms, and asynchronous communication.
  - Study event-driven architectures and how to use Kafka or other streaming technologies for real-time data processing.
- Microservices Architecture:
  - Understand the concept of microservices (small, independently deployable services) vs monolithic architectures.
  - Learn about service discovery, API Gateway, and inter-service communication (REST, gRPC, messaging systems).
  - Data management in microservices: Managing data consistency across services (eventual consistency, Saga pattern).
  - Study the 12-factor app methodology for designing cloud-native apps.
- Consistency Models:
  - Learn the concepts of strong consistency, eventual consistency, and causal consistency.
  - Study distributed transactions and patterns like two-phase commit and Sagas.

#### 4. Designing Scalable Systems
- Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling:
  - Learn when to scale horizontally (add more machines) vs vertically (upgrade the machine).
  - Study the design of scalable web apps, databases, and caching systems.
- Database Sharding:
  - Learn different ways to partition data: Range-based, Hash-based, Directory-based sharding.
  - Understand the implications of sharding on queries and performance.
- Partition Tolerance and CAP Theorem:
  - Deep dive into the CAP Theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) and the trade-offs systems make.
  - Learn strategies for handling network partitioning and achieving consistency and availability in different situations.

#### 5. Design Patterns in System Design
- Event Sourcing:
  - Understand how to design systems based on event logs where state is derived from events.
  - Learn how this helps in implementing CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for better separation of concerns.
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):
  - Understand the application of CQRS to optimize for different use cases by separating read models from write models.
- Sharding Strategies:
  - Explore different strategies to shard data across databases.
  - Study how to make queries efficient in a sharded environment.

#### 6. Designing Specific Systems
- URL Shortener:
  - Study how to design a system that takes long URLs and generates short links.
  - Focus on components like unique key generation (hashing), data storage, and redirection.
- E-commerce System:
  - Learn how to design the backend for an e-commerce platform.
  - Focus on inventory management, user authentication, cart systems, payment processing, and recommendation engines.
- Social Media System:
  - Study the design of a social media platform with features like user profiles, posts, comments, and real-time updates.
  - Learn how to scale the system for millions of users and handle high traffic loads.
- Real-Time Messaging System:
  - Study the architecture of systems like WhatsApp or Slack that support real-time communication.
  - Focus on message queues, message persistence, notifications, and scaling.

#### 7. Fault Tolerance and Reliability
- Redundancy:
  - Study how to implement data and system redundancy to handle hardware failures.
  - Learn about hot standbys and cold standbys.
- Failover and Recovery:
  - Understand how to design systems that failover to backup resources in case of failure.
  - Study backup strategies, system state recovery, and disaster recovery planning.

#### 8. Monitoring and Logging
- Distributed Tracing:
  - Learn how to monitor and debug distributed systems using tools like Jaeger or Zipkin.
- Logging:
  - Study centralized logging using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- Metrics and Monitoring:
  - Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track system performance, latency, and resource utilization.
