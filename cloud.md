  - Storage Services: S3 (AWS), Google Cloud Storage (GCP), Blob Storage (Azure).
  - Databases:
    - Managed Databases: RDS (AWS), Cloud SQL (GCP), Azure SQL.
    - NoSQL Databases: DynamoDB (AWS), Firestore (GCP), CosmosDB (Azure).
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM):
    - Learn IAM policies, roles, users, and permissions.
  - Load Balancers:
    - ELB (AWS), Load Balancing (GCP), Azure Load Balancer.
  - Serverless:
    - AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions.
  - Containers and Kubernetes:
    - ECS (AWS), GKE (GCP), AKS (Azure).
  - Monitoring and Logging:
    - CloudWatch (AWS), Stackdriver (GCP), Azure Monitor.

#### 2. Serverless Architecture
- Introduction:
  - Understand what serverless is and how it differs from traditional server-based models.
  - Learn the benefits: auto-scaling, reduced operational overhead, and event-driven architecture.
  - Understand the pricing model (based on usage).
- AWS Lambda:
  - Functions: Learn how to create, deploy, and trigger Lambda functions.
  - Triggers: Understand how Lambda can be triggered by events from services like S3, SNS, DynamoDB, etc.
  - API Gateway: Integrate Lambda with API Gateway to create RESTful APIs.
  - IAM Roles: Assign roles to Lambda functions for secure access to resources.
  - Logging: Use CloudWatch for logging Lambda executions.
- Google Cloud Functions:
  - Create and deploy functions with GCP’s Cloud Functions.
  - Integrate with Google Cloud Pub/Sub, HTTP triggers, and Firestore.
- Azure Functions:
  - Learn how to create serverless functions in Azure.
  - Integrate with Azure Event Grid, Storage, Service Bus.
- Serverless Frameworks:
  - Use frameworks like the Serverless Framework to manage serverless applications.
  - Use tools like AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) and Google Cloud Functions Framework.

#### 3. CI/CD Pipelines
- Introduction to CI/CD:
  - CI (Continuous Integration): Automate the process of merging code into a shared repository.
  - CD (Continuous Deployment): Automate the deployment to staging/production.
- Version Control Systems:
  - Use Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) for version control.
  - Learn Git workflows: Feature Branch Workflow, GitFlow Workflow, Forking Workflow.
- CI/CD Tools:
  - Jenkins:
    - Install and configure Jenkins locally or on a cloud VM.
    - Learn about Jenkins pipelines (Declarative and Scripted pipelines).
    - Integrate Jenkins with GitHub/GitLab for automatic triggering of builds.
    - Set up Jenkins to deploy to different environments (e.g., staging, production).
  - GitHub Actions:
    - Automate workflows directly in GitHub using Actions.
    - Set up workflows for builds, testing, and deployments.
    - Learn about GitHub’s Matrix builds for parallel execution.
  - GitLab CI/CD:
    - Create `.gitlab-ci.yml` for build, test, and deployment.
    - Set up CI/CD pipelines to deploy to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP).
    - Use GitLab CI/CD for both cloud and on-premise deployments.
  - Docker:
    - Containerize your applications and integrate them with CI/CD pipelines.
    - Build Docker images in Jenkins/GitLab.
- Best Practices:
  - Automate unit, integration, and UI testing.
  - Use versioning for deployments (e.g., tagging Docker images).
  - Integrate security checks into pipelines (e.g., static code analysis, vulnerability scanning).

#### 4. Logging and Monitoring
- Logging:
  - Learn the importance of centralized logging in cloud applications.
  - Set up logging for your applications (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, GCP Stackdriver, Azure Monitor).
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):
  - Elasticsearch: Store and search logs efficiently.
  - Logstash: Ingest and parse logs from various sources.
  - Kibana: Visualize and analyze logs with rich dashboards.
  - Set up the ELK Stack locally or on cloud services (e.g., AWS Elasticsearch Service).
  - Parse JSON and unstructured logs for real-time monitoring.
- Prometheus:
  - Set up Prometheus for monitoring containerized applications.
  - Learn about time-series data and Prometheus queries.
  - Monitor application performance (e.g., request latency, error rates).
- Grafana:
  - Integrate Prometheus with Grafana for visualization.
  - Create custom dashboards for monitoring application health, usage, and system metrics.
  - Set up alerts in Grafana to trigger based on threshold values.
- Monitoring and Observability:
  - Cloud-native Monitoring:
    - Use cloud-specific monitoring services: CloudWatch (AWS), Stackdriver (GCP), Azure Monitor.
    - Set up CloudWatch alarms for resource utilization.
    - Set up CloudWatch logs and metrics for monitoring and alerting.
  - Distributed Tracing:
    - Use tools like AWS X-Ray or Google Cloud Trace to monitor end-to-end application flows for latency issues and bottlenecks.
- Alerting and Incident Management:
  - Learn how to set up automated alerts based on application or infrastructure health.
  - Integrate monitoring tools with services like PagerDuty or Opsgenie for real-time alerts and incident management.
